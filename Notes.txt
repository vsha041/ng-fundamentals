Angular Application Bootstrap

-Angular components are made up of hierarchical tree. The root of that tree is app component.

Bootstrap Process

1. The bootstrapping of the app begins with main.ts file.
This is configured in Angular.json file as main property in Angular.json file is pointing to main.ts file.

2. Main.ts is the first component that's loaded. Notice in main.ts, it is bootstrapping app module.
Note that module comprises components.

3. And then app.module.ts bootstraps AppComponent.

This is why Angular App itself bootstraps with AppComponent.

Displaying Process

1. As per above Angular App starts with AppComponent. But what decides what to display during bootstrap in the UI?
2. The app component has a selector called app-root.
3. And the index.html file has <app-root> tag.

Adding component, pipe or directive inside a module (e.g. in app.module.ts)

1. You will need its declaration in the declarations section in the app.module.ts

Adding service inside a module (e.g. in app.module.ts)

1. Services are added in the providers section in the app.module.ts

Importing other existing modules

1. Imports array section in the app.module.ts is for importing other existing modules
